Manage Component Data
When the state values changes, the UI Re-Renders.

Use Props
------------
Use for Event Handling , to pass data ,functions to component
You can pass props to nested component "Props Drilling"

UseReducer
------------

The useReducer hook is a built-in React hook that provides an alternative to useState for managing state in functional components. It is particularly useful when:

State logic is complex (e.g., involves multiple sub-values or decisions).
The next state depends on the previous state.
You want a more predictable and maintainable way to update state—especially as your application grows.
